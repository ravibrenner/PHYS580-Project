# PHYS580-Project
Code from my project. Python code written in Spyder (via Anaconda navigator)
I would recommend copy-pasting a section of code into your preferred python IDE to run it.
#%% seperates cells in spyder, but might not work in other environments, so look out for those in the code to
see the beginning and end of sections.

Feel free to vary some of the initial values for dim, i, and r. Be careful, as some values won't work if they
are out of range.
